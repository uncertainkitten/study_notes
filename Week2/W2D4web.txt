What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?
sessionStorage, predictably, only persists for the duration of the session (i.e., until tab or page close).  Notably, though, it does survive page
refresh

Why is it important that users cannot modify their cookies?
Cookies generally are where authentication and other sensitive, useful data goes.  It's important that these are protected by XSS attacks and 
script injection, so modern browsers make it difficult to modify cookies, as well as allow prevention of JS access to cookies

When are cookies sent to the server?
Valid cookies for a page are sent at _every_ request made to a page in the same domain.

localStorage vs. sessionStorage
the difference is that sessionStorage does not persist and is only available for the duration of the browser session.  However,
it does survive page reloads.

It is not a good idea to store secure or sensitive data in sessionStorage or localStorage - these can be easily read and modified by the
client

Modern browsers prevent access to cookies from Javascript as a protection from XSS attacks and script injection by setting an HTTP only flag
