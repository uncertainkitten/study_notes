What are the common HTTP methods? When are they used, and what do they accomplish? (This is a big one)
Common HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE, though HEAD, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE exist
GET is used to retrieve information from a server - it does not modify or otherwise mess with representations of data.
POST is used to send representations of data to a server, which will be processed and a response accepting or refusing the data is sent
PUT/PATCH requests are used to replace representations of the target resource with whatever content is uploaded
DELETE removes all current representations of the target resource given by the URI
HEAD is a get request that only returns the status and header
CONNECT establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the URI - this is where the three-step handshake comes information
OPTIONS describes communication options for the target resource
TRACE performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource

HTTP
GET:  Used to retrieve information from the server of a given URI.  GET should only retrieve data and have no other effect on the data
HEAD:  Same as get, but used only to transfer status line and header
POST:  A post request is used to send data to the server using HTML forms
PUT/PATCH: Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content
DELETE:  Removes all current representations of the target resource given by the URI
CONNECT:  Establishes a tunnel to the server ID'd by the URI
OPTIONS:  Describes the communication options for the target resource
TRACE: Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource

POST data is processed by a process.cgi, and then a response will be sent acknowledge or refusing the change.
