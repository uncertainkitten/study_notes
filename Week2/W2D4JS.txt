What is event delegation?

Event delegation is the idea that, if we have a bunch of elements listening for events that will get handled in a similar way, then we can put the
event listener on a common ancestor. In the handler, we set event.target to specify where we want the event handled.

Event delegation is the idea that, if we have a bunch of elements listening for events that will get handled in a similar way, then we can put the

So instead of putting an onClick on each an every element in a list or a table, you can put it on the parent element for the entire thing - and then
cause whatever you want to happen to happen to event.target, because that information will still be recorded.

The drawback?  There might be elements within your subelements that get clicked, and you don't want the event to ONLY happen to that subelement (like
a p tag), you want it to happen to the table entry, or the list item.  You can use conditionals to handle this, however - if you are looking
for a specific tag, then you make sure that it only triggers when event.target is that tag

Additionally, you can set "data-action" to have different elements do different things
