What is an XMLHttpRequest?

Essentially, a Javascript object meant to handle requests and serve responses in ways that don't require updating the entire DOM synchronously


AJAX - not a programming language, allows you to access servers from a webpage, stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML

AJAX is a combination of: a built-in browser XMLHttpRequest request object, Javascript, and HTML DOM
So what is an XMLHttpRequest? 
An XMLHttpRequest is a Javascript object with the following properties:
onreadystatechange (Event Handler called when the ready state changes)
readyState(an unsigned, short representation of the state of the request)
response(an array buffer, blob, document, javascript object, or DOMString response sent by the server to the request)
responseText(a DOMString containing the response to the request)
responseType(enumerated value that defines the response type)
responseURL(serialized URL of the response)
responseXML(returns a Document containing the response to the request)
status(unsigned short with the status of the response to the request)
statusText(contains the full text of the status of the response to the request)
timeout(unsigned long indicating how many ms can pass before the request is terminated)
ontimeout(Event Handler called if the request times out)
withCredentials(Boolean representing whether cross-site Access-Control requests should be made using creds such as cookies or auth headers)

Useful notes: if XML is sent back instead of static HTML, you must set response headers to work in IE.
If you don't set Cache-Control: no-cache, the browser will cache the response and never re-submit the request - this can make debugging challenging
if httpRequest is used globally, functions calling makeRequest() can overwrite each other, creating race conditions
