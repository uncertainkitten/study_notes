Discuss the differences between let, const, and var. What are their respective scopings?
Var: function-scoped, hoisted to the top of scope
Let, const: block-scoped, a pair of curly braces defines the scope in which they are defined.

Before ES6 - could only dec variables with var
variables were function-scoped
Within block-scopes (like conditionals), vars can be accessed outside the conditional
Undeclared variables automatically create a var in the global scope.
