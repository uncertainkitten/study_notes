What are the advantages and disadvantages of NoSQL databases vs. SQL databases?
Advantages of NoSQL - usually very fast, very available, handles complex queries better.  also can be very quick to set up
Disadvantages of NoSQL - usually less consistent, requires more expertise, doesn't work well with ACID (so ungreat for financials)

Well, NoSQL was made around 12 years ago for a reason - people wanted to make more complex queries and get more inference out of their data, and 
the data itself became more complex.  SQL also had situations where complying with ACID standards and making sure that records would lock when they 
were requested to prevent untoward changes meant that "web scale attacks", i.e., a ton of attempts to read data from millions of users, would lead to 
database information being unavailable.  So, while this standard is still necessary for financial transactions, you can be a bit more sloppy with less
critical things - it's ok if wrong data displays for a few moments.

NoSQL is sometimes arranged with key-value structure, columnar structure.  High speed databases that borrow from SQL are occasionally referred to as
NewSQL

Hadoop - collects a ton of data, runs MapReduce on it, makes it real cheap to analyze the data.  It looks like Hadoop changes "here's the data and how
to relate it - figure out how to ask me" of SQL into "Here's a bunch of data, what's an interesting relation"

MongoDB - documents and key value pairs, tends to be much faster to get up and running and to key into

CouchBase - good for inconsistent demand, follows CAP principle (Consistency, Availability and Partitionability) and opts for Consistency
and Partitionability
