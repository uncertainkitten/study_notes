The C Programming Language

Data type: fundamental - characters, integers, and floating points
Hierarchy of derived data types - pointers, arrays, structures, unions

Expressions - formed from operators and operands
Control flow constructions - fundamental:
statement grouping, decision making (if-else), case statements (switch), loops at the top (while, for), loops at the bottom (do), early loop exit (break)

Functions can return values of: basic types, structures, unions, or pointers
Function definitions - cannot be nested, though variables may be declared in a block-structured fashion

Variables can be scoped (internal to function, to all of source file, to entire program)

Functions can be recursive, local variables are recreated with each invocation.

Preprocessing step - peforms macro substitution on program text, inclusion of other source files, and conditional compilation.

C does not have operations to deal directly with composite structures (strings, arrays, sets, lists) - structures are defined statically, no garbage
collection or heap

No in built file access in C.  C is single threaded.  No typecasting

Chapter 1
When you run a C program, it outputs a .out file - you run that .out file with ./$filename.out

Breaking down Hello World - all C source files need to have a main(), though there may be other functions acting as helpers.
