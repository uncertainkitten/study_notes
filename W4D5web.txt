When does DNS load-balancing become necessary?
When you have multiple machines in an application tier to handle requests

What is the principle of Least Privilege and how does it relate to the responsibilities of the Load Balancer?
The principle of least privilege is that you should gate access to any resource based on the minimum amount of privilege required to complete the task
Essentially, don't allow access to things that are unnecessary.  The load balancer can use this to determine which ports it should be listening on to 
serve requests.
