What are presentational components?
Components that are mostly concerned with how the component looks, not the actual behavior of the component - the behavior logic goes into a
different component, passing props as needed to the presentational component


React todoList example:
The essential idea is that instead of using component state, you use the global state and event handlers to update state on the page
Also, you can use style= and text decoration to take advantage of global toggles
