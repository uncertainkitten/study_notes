HTTP status codes:
1xx - Informational:
100 - Continue
Client should continue - this is an acknowledgement that the initial part of the request has been received (request headers received,
client should send request body)

101 - Switching Protocols
Client has asked the server to switch protocols, and the server acknowledges this and will do so (such as, upgrade to newer version of HTTP,
or to Websockets)

102 - Processing
Interim response used to tell the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it.  This is usually sent
for requests that will take some time to complete (guideline is >20 seconds).  This serves to keep client from timing out connections

2xx - Success:
200 - OK
Request succeeded, information requested gets sent

201 - Created
Request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created.  The resource can be accessed with the URI returned by the location address in the header
of the response

202 - Accepted
Request accepted for processing, but the processing is incomplete.  This code is non-committal, but does not require the user-agent to remain
connected

203 - Non-authoritative information
Information from header isn't from the origin server, may be a local or third-party copy.  So the request was successful but info is returned from
another source

204 - No Content
The request was completed successfully but the server does not need to return anything

205 - Reset Content
Request completed successfully, server is not returning content, but the client should reset the document view

206 - Partial Content
The server is only delivering part of the content due to a range header set by the client

207 - Multi-status
The message body that follows is an XML message and may contain a number of separate response codes

208 - Already Reported
The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a previous reply to this request, and are not being included again.

226 - IM used
The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more
instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.

3xx - Redirection:
300 - Multiple Choices
There are multiple paths to the requested resource

301 - Moved Permanently
This + all future requests should be redirected to the new URI

302 - Found
Requested resource temporarily resides under a new URI - original URI should still be used for requests given the redirection might be altered

303 - See Other
Response to request may be found under another URI

304 - Not Modified
Resource has not been modified since last requested - saves bandwidth and reprocessing

305 - Use Proxy
Requested resource MUST be accessed through a Proxy

306 - (Unused)
No longer used. Originally meant "Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy."

307 - Temporary Redirect
Request should be repeated with another URI, future requests should use original URI

308 - Permanent Redirect
The request, and all future requests should be repeated using another URI.

307 and 308 are different from 301 and 302 because they do not require the HTTP method to change
