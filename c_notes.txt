C - invented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie

Hello World in C:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
  printf("Hello world");
  return 0;
}

Printing newlines in C:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    printf("Have fun with this course!");
    return 0;
}

\ - begins an escape sequence
\n - new line
Note - you can do all this in one printf statement

Printing quotation marks:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    printf("Have fun with \"this\" course!");
    return 0;
}

Use \ before the thing you want to escape and all is well

For loops in C:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    int i = 0;
    for(i=0; i<9; i++){
        printf("Hello, world!\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

So define a variable, tell it how long to increment or decrement, and do your thing.
Hey look it is literally basically JavaScript

You can also run blocks of code in for loops (again, just like JavaScript, Ruby, whatever).  Do note that you can keep using the same fancy incrementing
variable - I _assume_ that i is scoped to the loop it's associated with (alternatively, every time you do i=0 in the first part of the loop, you're
resetting the value.  This would make more sense, probably.)

Example:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    int i=0;
    for(i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("Blah");
        printf("Bleh");
        printf("Blih ");
    }
    printf("\n");
    for (i=0; i<6; i++) {
        printf("Bloh");
        printf("Bluh ");
    }
    return 0;
}

Commenting
You comment things with // on new line (again, just like Javascript)
You can also comment code at end of line with // like usual - and you can also just comment out code so
You can comment over multiple lines with /* */(just like CSS)
And you can have comments in comments by combining // and /* */

Structure of a C program
#include <stdio.h> - preprocessor directive (code that runs before code is compiled)
int main(void) - all programs need to have a "main" function, and can only have one main function
int i = 0; - variable declaration
executable statements (things like for loops, printfs, etc.)
return - end of the function
