When are two pages considered to have the same origin?
Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, the port, and the host are the same

How might you allow cross-origin resource sharing?
You can allow it by having a CORS policy in place, or not using CSRF tokens (don't do this)

What is CORS?
CORS is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

What the fuck is a same origin policy?
Well - it's a security policy that restricts how a document/script from one origin is permitted ot interact with a resource from another origin
Two pages have the SAME origin if: the protocol, the port, and the host are the same.  (referenced as scheme/host/port tuple)

Things: Origins can be inherited from scripts executed from pages with an about:blank or a javascript: URL

IE screwing things up like usual:
Trust zones - if two domains are in a "high trust zone", same-origin limitations are not applied
Port - IE doesn't check port for same origin checks

You can _sort_ of change origins, via setting document.domain to the current domain or a superdomain of the current domain.  You can't spoof another
site's origin this way.  Any document.domain call sets the port to "null"

cross-origin network access: Cross-origin _writes_ are typically allowed (links, redirects, form submissions)
cross-origin embeds are usually allowed (scripts, css, images, media, plugins, @font-face, frame/iframe)
cross-origin reads are typically DISALLOWED, though read access can be leaked by embeddding.

A CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) policy can cross-origin access
How to block cross-origin access:
CSRF tokens can prevent cross-origin writes
Prevent cross-origin reads by preventing embedding of resources
To prevent cross-origin embeds, ensure that your resource cannot be interpreted as one of the embeddable formats.  CSRF tokens can also prevent embedding

Cross origin data storage access:
localStorage and IndexedDB: not cross origin touchable
Cookies: Pages can set cookies for own domain or parent domain, as long as parent domain is not a public suffix
Writing cookies allow you to set: Domain, Path, Secure, and HTTP-only flags
Reading cookies: You can't see from where it was set
