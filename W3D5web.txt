What are the issues one may face when scaling horizontally?
Often involves downtime to add machines to the array
Redundancy becomes much more important, since you have to distribute requests to make use of the system
You have to deal with consistency issues and making sure that data propogates properly throughout your system array


What is Vertical Scaling?
Vertical scaling is making a more powerful machine as your single node for your data.

Horizontal scaling - add moar machines to your pool!
Vertical scaling - maek better machine, add moar power!

Database scaling horizontally generally involves partitioning the data. Scaling vertically usually means having all the data reside on a single node
with a lot of power.  Horizontal scaling allows for more dynamic scaling, whereas vertical scaling is limited by ceilings on machine power

In-Memory data grids are optimized for both horizontal and vertical scaling due to not being bound to disk.
