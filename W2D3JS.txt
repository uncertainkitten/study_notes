How can you stop event bubbling?
event.stopPropagation

What is the difference between event.target and event.currentTarget?
event.target - the element on which the event actually occurred ( the most deeply nested element causing the event )
event.currentTarget - the element that currently has the event handler running

What does stopImmediatePropagation do?
Prevents other event handlers on the _same_ element from going off.

Bubbling and capturing:
When an event happens on an element, the handler on that element is triggered, then handlers on each parent, and then each parent's parent, etc. all
the way up the ancestral element tree

(Some events don't do this like focus, but most do)

event.target tells us information about the most deeply nested element that caused the event.
"this", or event.currentTarget, is the element that currently has the event handler running

The method to stop event bubbling is e.stopPropagation
e.stopImmediatePropagation stops _multiple handlers_ from going off on the same element.  Essentially, if you have multiple things going on, any event
handler with stopImmediatePropagation will just stop the event in total.

Note - don't stop bubbling without a need - it can sometimes bite you later if you change the functionality of the site and cause weird dead zones for
things like onClicks

Capturing - another phase of event processing
Capturing phase - the event propagating _down_ to the target
If you set the third argument of addEventListener to true - it will listen for the capturing phase
event.eventPhase tells you what number phase the event was caught (also rarely used tho)
