 Explain TCP, and why it is a necessary protocol
 TCP is a protocol to make sure data gets from one place to another.  The way it does this is breaking up the data into smaller pieces so that 
 it can more flexibly be routed through a variety of interconnected machines until the data reaches its destination.  TCP then handles acknowledgement
 of the packets, confirming that they have all been received and reassembled.  It is necessary to make sure that data makes it safely through the Internet
 in a fast and efficient manner.

 TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol

 TCP/IP is made up of layers:
 Top layer is Application layer - this has protocols such as HTTP or SMTP
 Next layer is the transport layer - this is where TCP lives (UDP also lives here)
 TCP chops up the data from the application layer into packets, and puts a header on top so that the packets can be put back together well
 After this, the packets go to the Internet layer, where IP lives
 Network layer is the last layer, handling things like MAC addresses and other hardware stuff - it makes sure it goes to the right machine and the
 electrical signals make sense

 Packets, routers, and reliability:
 TCP/IP breaks things into packets, and routers redirect those packets around until they reach their destinations.  It's ok if they arrive out of order
 because the headers allow you to reassemble them.  Routers keep track of cheapest paths (which can be influenced by company relations,
 politics, congestion, etc.).  TCP manages the packets - it acknowledges each packet, and will only confirm the delivery of the data if all the packets
 are there.  If there isn't a confirmation, the packets are re-sent
