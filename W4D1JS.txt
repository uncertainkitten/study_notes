Does JS assign variables by value or by reference?

Well, it depends.  Simple values (null, undefined, boolean, number, string, and ES6 symbol) are assigned by value
Compound values(Objects, including arrays and functions) create a copy of the reference on assignment

So, if you want to copy a compound _value_, you need to actually copy the entire thing
