Why would you want to use an LRU cache in a backend server?
To keep your memcache fresh and make sure that the most frequently used queries are the ones getting cached

In the Master-Slave paradigm, what tasks are commonly done by the slave databases and why?
Slave databases are largely responsible for read tasks - applications that have a lot of read requests and fewer write requests benefit from
this model

In a multi-tiered architecture, how do we get redundancy and responsiveness?
You can use Active-Active load balancer setups, and Master-Slave and Master-Master (or Leader-Follower Leader-Leader) set ups in order to handle
failures automatically without human intervention.  This also increases responsiveness because setups like Leader-Leader and Active-Active make 
your servers high availiability.
