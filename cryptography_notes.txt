Asymmetric encryption:
Generate two keys, which can't be guessed from one another, but the keys can encode and decode the same things
So if you generate a key pair like this, you have a public key that you publish for everyone, and then you have a private key which lets you
have a public key that can encode something and a private key that can decode it (so if someone knows your public key, they can send you an encoded
message you can decode, and you can reply using their public key)

Additionally, you can _encode_ a message with your private key and people can decode with your public key, so that they know _for sure_ that the message
is coming from you.

SHA:
Secure Hash Algorithm (tho it's been broken so)
Basic idea of a hash function: Turns a string into a fixed length output
So, invented by the NSA in 1995, more or less extends md5
Generates a 160 bit string - how?  It does a loop that takes 512 bit blocks of data one at a time until the file is expended
SHA1 - takes a message of n blocks of 512 bits in length - if it is exactly 1 block, then the hash is run once, and it outputs that string
SHA1 - starts with an internal state, brings in bits of the message, changes the internal state, and then we read the internal state once its done
Step by step:
Call the internal state H:
The internal state starts at 160 bits (5 32 bit words, 4 bytes each)
So lets say we have H0, H1, H2, H3, H4, all representing one of the words
Essentially we run a compression function (80 times), adding parts of the message into other parts of the message and increasing the appearance of
randomness - however we need to make sure this hash function is still this specific message, not a general one.
Once this is done, the new representations of the original message are added to the internal state
SHA notably does not allow buffer overflow - it modulos results by 2 ^ 32 - this in turn makes the SHA hashing algo one way.
It's fine that it's one way because we're operating on the representation.
If the message if 512 bits, you're done
If not, you keep copying the new internal state, running the function, and adding it to the next block until you run out blocks
If it's not a multiple of 512 bits, you have to do some padding - this basically involves marking padding with a 1, adding a bunch of 0s, putting
the message length at the end, and ending on a 1
This entire structure is a Merkel Damgard Construction

The issue with SHA1 is that there's not as much possibility space as it seems at first, so it can be cracked

Messages/stream ciphers - message authentication codes:
Usually messages are sent encrypted - this doesn't in fact protect from interception, alteration, or anything like that
MAC - Message Authentication Code
This creates a guarantee the message hasn't been changed
Usually encrypting using a stream cipher or a block cipher
To cipher - we start with plaintext, use a pseudorandom stream key (such as XOR), and then we send the flipped bits
Usually, changing a bit will wreck the message for decryption - however, stream ciphers go bit by bit, so you can safely change a given bit
maliciously
So first - hash the message, add the hash to the end of the message - except this is crackable because you can change the message and recompute the hash
So, you need a "shared secret" - something both you and the person you're communicating with, and tack _that_ hash at the end of your message
The issue here is that, we can append to the message instead of adding to it, by guessing the length of the shared message (issue with Merkel Damgard constructions)
So, the actual thing - This is the HMAC approach - this involves _two_ hashes, and doesn't fall prey to length extension attacks
So you take key 1 and key 2, hash them, and then add the hashes together and hash those
How do we derive the key?  Take two constants, XOR them with the key separately
so internal pad and outer pad, and then we do the hash thing, and this I guess can change the length of the keys while still being separable

Secret Key Exchange (Diffe Hellman):
So the previous things assume we have a symmetric key and use it to talk securely.  So how do we get that secret key?  Diffe Hellman
Diffe-Hellman is mathematically complex
So we don't exchange keys directly - what we do is exchange public variables, combine them with some private variables, such that we can generate the
same key

So, let's see this:
Alice|Public|Bob
Before anything, Alice and Bob have to agree to mathematical parameters - g, for generator, and a large prime number n
g and n are public - shared at the beginning of the handshake
Privately - Alice has a private key (a) she's generated and keeps to herself.  Same with Bob (b)
So first, we combine the private key with the generator - once they're combined, it's difficult to separate them (so we have ag and bg)
Next, they exchange ag and bg (So Bob has ag, Alice has bg)
After that, Alice adds her private key to bg, getting abg
Bob adds his private key to ag, getting bag
Multiplication is communative so now they both have the same key, but an attacker can't make this key from ag or bg

Diffie-Hellman, the maths:
g - a very small prime number
n - a very large prime number
Using a lot of modular arithmetic, what happens?
n is usually 2000 to 4000 bits
Alice picks a, Bob picks b
a is between 1 and n, b is between 1 and n
Alice - g^a % n
Bob - g^b % n

Alice gets Bob's g^b % n, and Bob gets Alice's g^a % n
Then they put it to the power of their respective private variables, making both variables g^ab % n

Key exchange problems:
Man in the middle attacks - so we do Diffe-Hellman, but we have Sean the Suspicious Person intercepting messages
So he basically pretends to be Bob in response to Alice's initial handshake, and instead of producing g^ab, we get g^as, and Alice is unwitting
Additionally, Sean communicates with Bob, pretending to be Alice, creating g^bs (ha)
What this means is Sean can get the messages from both, read the messages, and do whatever he wants with them.  Let it through, change it, etc.

So now we have RSA to save us :O!
Now we go back to private key/public key
So Alice sends g^a, and Bob sends back g^b and _signs it with his private key_
Then Alice applies Bob's public key to the encrypted private key to confirm Bob is Bob
And then Alice does the thing for Bob as well
Sean no longer can intercept and pretend to be Bob because he doesn't have Bob's private key

You can use RSA without Diffe Hellman - The issue with RSA only is that if anyone ever breaks the keys, they can go back and decrypt all historic messages
between Bob and Alice.  Diffe Hellman constrains things to session


Elliptic Curves:
What is an elliptic curve?  y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
Parameters of the curve - a and b
The g^ab % n is a cycle of numbers - Elliptic curves create a cycle of points
So to create this, we add g to itself, getting 1g, 2g, 3g, etc. - we do this by taking a tangent line to the curve, and then flip it to the other 
dimension - every time we add g, we go to a point generated by the previous addition, find an intersection, and take that point.  This allows for
movement that looks apparently random but does have a rule that can be used by people who have the correct information (You only intersect one points
on the curve at a time)
The number of times we move around g is the private number

So why elliptic curve over modulo math?  Largely, this is a little harder to solve, and requires less computation
Elliptic curve at 256 bits is a little stronger than Diffe Hellman at 3000 bits on n
The drawbacks are some people are suspicious of where the common curve equations come from, and prefer using modulo
