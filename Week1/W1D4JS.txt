 Is Javascript a single-threaded language? Explain (Hint: This may not be a yes or no question)
 Soooorta.  Javascript is "A single-threaded non-blocking asynchronous concurrent language" - meaning, yes, it is single threaded, but can handle
 asynchronicity via concurrency.  The non-blocking part is essentially the event loop - if you arrange your slower functions to be passed to the event
 loop, then they won't block your stack.  So, JS is single threaded but has handlers for multiple functions to execute "at once", even if it is not
 actually parallelizable.
