 Name 5 benefits of HTML5
  Accessibility with semantic tags - it's easier to read with screen readers

 What is localStorage? How might you use it?
  A cross between cookies and a client-side db - it lets you use the browser as a storage space to persist state across sessions without relying on third
  party storage tools on the client side.  You might use it to save an ongoing score in a clicker game.

 Why are media queries useful?
  They let you write CSS in a way that respects the screen size so that your elements render in a pleasing fashion

 What is mobile-first design? Be as specific as possible.
  Mobile first design is setting your basic structure to render well on a mobile screen - keeping elements within the first breakpoint, sizing them and
  using space so that your design is light, fast, and fits well on page.  From there you add how the elements might expand into larger screens.

 Benefits of HTML5
 Accessibility - semantic tags, ARIA (W3C spec that assigns roles to semantic elements)
 Video and Audio support - replaces Flash player/other third party players, simplifies embedding
 Doctype - More simply defines the document as an HTML document rather than cluttering head
 Cleaner code - Semantic tags again
 Smarter storage - Localstorage - a cross between cookies and a client-side db.
 Better interactions - Canvas, drag and drop, browser history management, doc editing, timed media playback
 Game development - Canvas still, removes need for third party libraries like Flash
 Legacy support - Older browsers can use it
 Mobile - Viewport, full screen browsing, home screen icons
 It's the future I guess

 Media queries - allowing you to condition CSS on the size of the screen
