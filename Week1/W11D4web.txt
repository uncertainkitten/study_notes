 Why do we need a DNS?
 So essentially, we need a DNS to allow IP addresses to be human accessible, and to be able to (relatively) quickly search for things - so it uses a 
 tree structure to accomplish this and makes the entire process of accessing a webpage much easier than having to remember a bunch of IP addresses or 
 try to iteratively hit every server in the world in search of an address.

 well first, what is a DNS?  A DNS is a domain name server - it recursively checks the path to find the IP address you're trying to go to

 Steps to a DNS request:
 First you ask your browser to go to a site
 Then the browser queries a DNS resolver - the DNS resolver is there to translate the request into something the DNS server can parse
 The DNS resolver queries the root servers to find the TLD (like .com)
 Then the DNS resolve queries the server for that TLD - for .com, this is Verisign.  Then it gets back the server hosting the rest of the address,
 as well as the IP for that server
 Then you query the IP address you just got back, sending an HTTP request
 And then the website files are delivered to browser
