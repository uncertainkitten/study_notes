What are the steps for BFS on a graph?

You start traversal from a node on the graph (usually the first label order node)
You put that node in the queue, and you visit the adjacent nodes in label order
You put those nodes in the queue one at a time.
Once you've run out of unvisited adjacent nodes, you move on to the next node in the queue.
Rinse and repeat until you've run out of nodes in your queue
