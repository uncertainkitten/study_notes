What is database partitioning?
If you segment the data you are storing on a given database tier, you can set things up so that you are distributing the load across multiple database
tiers, which allows for more redundancy at the expense of having all your data in one place.

Explain high availability and how it relates to the master-master paradigm
High availability is the idea that if something fails, there is something to catch that failure and take over the duties of the failed hardware until
the failed hardware can be fixed.  The Master-Master paradigm is an example of this because both databases are talking to each other and handling write
requests, and also paying attention to whether the other one is still receiving packets - and if it stops, taking over all the requests so that the
databases are still available
