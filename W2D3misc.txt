Redux - avoiding array mutations
Concat vs. push - concat does not mutate the array.  Push does
.splice vs. .slice - slice is non mutating - you can remove an element from an array using slice in Redux
You can also use the ... spread operator instead of slice to make your code much nicer

Avoiding object mutations
Object.assign allows you to copy an object over to a new object, which you can safely change in Redux
(The first argument in Object.assign is what properties you want to mutate in the original object, if any.  This is why you pass an empty object as
this arg)
You can also spread an object the same way you would an array

Writing a todo list reducer:
Uh none of this is new
